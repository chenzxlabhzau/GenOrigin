# GenOrigin: A Comprehensive Gene Origination Database on the Evolutionary Timescale of Life

The origination and evolution of genes with novel functions are important to the functional studies of the genes. GenOrigin systematically infers the gene age of the 3,065,337 genes from 119 species in the timetree, and it provides the gene age based on the inferred branches and related publications.

In GenOrigin, users can:

- Browse or search genes of 119 species and obtain their age information;

- Browse or search species, and obtain species-specific genes;

- Download the gene age data inferred or collected by GenOrigin.
